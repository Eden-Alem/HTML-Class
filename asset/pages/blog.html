                    It does matter in the aspect of responsiveness using relative sizes for elements. As their name indicates these size units work relatively to the parent element and root element for em and rem units respectively. In using percentages which are more concerned with the viewport; decreasing the browsers width on desktop, results in scrollable content horizontally and vertically rather than accordingly adjusting to the new browser width.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compounding is a term found in using ems; 
                    <img width="300" height="650" src="../image/answer.JPG" alt="Compound description">
                    Considering the above html and css in the image the resulting output might seem a bit odd. In the above illustration, it was considered that the root element had a 10px font-sizing. And thus the span element's font size of 1.6em has a relativity concept in both the inner and outer span element. The outer text displayed in the outer span element has a size of 16px; 1.6 x 10 = 16px. And the inner span element's text is of 25.6px; this happened because the inner span element's font-size is 1.6em which is relative to its outer span element's font-size of 1.6em, which is in turn relative to its parent's font size of 10px declared. This certain problem that occurs in using the ems is known as compounding as mentioned earlier and is why rem values where invented in order for elements to stay relative to the root html element not parent element. And thus in assigning values for elements using the rem is more adviced to decrease incompliances and to be effective in issuing changes in the element's font size by changing the root element's size declaration.

            <p class="title">Browser interpretation in changing the default browser font size to 200px.</p>
            <article>
                <p>
                    By default the browser has a font size of 16px if any other value is not declared else where through out the html. In changing this value to 200px; has an effect on relative units such as ems and rems. As their name indicates there is a relativity context on the parent element and html(root) element respectively. Also in considering percentage values by the default browser's 16px value it holds that 16px = 100% so in changing the font size value to 200px results in 200px = 1250% thus increasing the font size 12.5 times the default size. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the browsers default interpretation 1em = 16px; if the body element is set to have a 200px value of font size then it will hold that 1em = 200px; not only the body element but if thus the html(root) element is set with the exact value the browser interprets it in the same way.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to rem values they are set relatively as the root elements font size thus changing the body element's font size to 200px brings no change on the interpretation of the browser as in 1rem = 16px as long as the root(html) element is not specified by another value declaration thus considering the default of 16px. A change is detected in rem values when the root(html) element has a change in value; considering 200px as its font size the resulting interpretation of the browser would be 1rem = 200px.
As a reference for this post and in further description of the browsers interpretation of value changes please refer this site: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size </a>

            <p class="title">Specific changes in CSS3</p>
            <article>
                <p>
                    CSS3 is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2.1; it brings with it new features of rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or animations, as well as new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts.    
                </p>
                <p>
                   <strong> CSS3 Selectors:</strong> With css3, applying styles individually has become way easier. The new selectors can identify elements based on it's attributes, the position in which they appear in the parent element and the state, among other properties. In attribute selectors, it was made possible to select elements based on their value of their attributes as their name indicates. As an illustration, we can select an input element with an attribute of type with value of text as input[type=text]{...}. For position selectors, elements can be selected based on their position in the document. As an example, its possible to select the second div element in the document and applying changes in the h1 it holds by div:nth-of-type(2)>h1{...} thus further specification could be possible if more than one h1 element exists and if the third h1 element with in the second is needed could be selected by div:nth-of-type(2)>h1:nth-of-type(3){...}. As in state selectors, it determines in the element being selected on its actual state. For instance, input elements that are checked could be selected by input:checked{...}. These are of the few possiblities and examples I have described in new selector features of CSS3 further information could be gained from the site: <a href="http://mrbool.com/the-new-css3-selectors/26734" target="_blank"> http://mrbool.com/the-new-css3-selectors/26734 </a>   
                </p>
                <p>
                   <strong> CSS3 Colors:</strong> With CSS3, additional lists of 147 keyword colors have been added to the color module and transparent colors have also been made possible by the RGBA, HSL and HSLA additional features. The RGBA declaration works the same as the RGB but this time adding a fourth value of the opacity level or alpha transparency level having a value from 0 to 1. Thus in making 1 fully opaque and 0 fully transparent, thus a range in between determines its transparency. HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness; with its declaration accepting three values the hue in degrees from 0 to 359, the saturation as a percentage of 100% being the full hue, and saturation of 0 giving you a shade of gray essentially causing the hue value to be ignored and a percentage for lightness of 100% being white, 50% being the actual hue, and 0% being black. The a in hsla() here also functions the same way as in rgba().    
                </p>
                <p>
                   <strong> CSS3 Border Property:</strong> The border-radius property was a new feature introduced helping in creating a rounded corner and thus also making four different border radius property declarations possible for four of the corners.
                </p>
                <p>                    
                   <strong> CSS3 Shadow Properties:</strong> Drop shadows and text shadows in CSS3 allows adding drop shadows using the box shadow property and adding shadows to individual characters in text nodes respectively. The box shadow property enables the specification of the color, height, width, blur, and offset of one or multiple inner and/or outer drop shadows of elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                   <strong> CSS3 Gradients:</strong> Linear gradients and radial gradients were introduced in blending colors with a certain flow in the output of different colors. As an illustration, background: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...); and background: radial-gradient(shape size at position, start-color, ..., last-color); are the syntaxes used respectively for each gradient type.
                </p>
                <p>
                   <strong> CSS3 Multiple Background Images:</strong> With CSS3, the ability of adding more than one background image to any element, even to pseudo-elements was made possible.
